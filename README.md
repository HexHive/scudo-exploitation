# Scudo Exploitation

This repository contains the artifacts of the [Exploiting Android's Hardened Memory Allocator](https://nebelwelt.net/publications/files/24WOOT.pdf) paper.

## gdb-plugin

The **gdb-plugin** folder contains the gdb plugin which helps analyzing the scudo heap state.
The plugin is designed to be used for `gef`. 
To use the plugin please install gef from: `https://github.com/hugsy/gef`

There is also a port for `pwndbg` at `gdb-plugin/scudo-pwndbg.py`. (Thanks to @ju256)

## scudocookie

A python3 library which allows to conveniently compute a chunk's checksum or bruteforce the cookie given a 
chunk's address and header.

Installation:
```
cd scudocookie && sudo python3 setup.py install
```

## exploits

A vulnerable heap menu program along with pwntools python3 scripts that 
showcase our exploitation techniques `forged CommitBase` and `safe unlink`.
In order to run the scripts please install scudocookie (you also need pwntools to run the python scripts).

Forged CommitBase exploit:
```
cd exploits && python3 forged_commitbase.py GDB
```

Safe Unlink exploit:
```
cd exploits && python3 safe_unlink.py GDB
```

Alternatively you can use the provided Dockerfile and run the exploits inside the docker with all dependencies.

```
cd exploits && ./build_docker.sh && ./run_docker.sh
```


## case-study

The artifacts used in our exploitation case study, in which we backported `CVE-2015-1528` and exploited the 
system server on Android 14.
For details on how to run it check the `README.md` in the case-study folder.
