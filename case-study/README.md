# Case Study

(Tested on ubuntu 22.04 x86_64) 

Run the exploit for yourself:
```
docker build . -t cve_emu
docker run --rm --name emu --device /dev/kvm -it cve_emu /bin/bash
```

Wait until the following is printed:
```
[+] running exploit                 [+]
```

Check if the exploit is being attempted with:
``` 
docker exec -it emu /bin/bash
adb logcat | grep scudo 
```
Each scudo error message complaining about a corrupted chunk header is one failed exploitation attempt.

If the exploit succeeds it writes a message to logcat by calling `__android_log_print`. 

To monitor if the exploit worked:
``` 
docker exec -it emu /bin/bash
adb logcat | grep H3Ll0
```

It usually takes around 5-20 attempts to make the exploit work.
